  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel algorithm to identify degradation in batteries used for power system applications. Unlike conventional battery control methods that try to extend battery lifetime by applying heuristic rules, this approach allows us to maximize battery lifetime within an optimal control framework. We use an online Least Squares (LS) identification method to develop a two-dimensional degradation map that describes the lost battery charge as a function of the battery state of charge and the applied current. We project the degradation map to an economic cost function that associates each discrete control action with its utilization cost. Additionally, we develop a nonlinear battery model to capture fast battery dynamics including the rate capacity effect and we identify its parameters with a nonlinear LS method. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by presenting a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for a peak shave application in which we use a linearized version of the battery model along with the degradation cost function. We use a high-fidelity lithium ion electrochemical battery model to simulate a real battery system and we show that the MPC scheme increases the battery lifetime by a factor of 2.6 and the internal rate of return by 11 percentage points as compared to conventional control approaches.},

  abstract = {In view of the complex energy coupling and multiple market entities competition in integrated energy system, a hybrid time-scale energy optimal scheduling model based on game interaction with supply and demand is presented. Considering the initiative of market players in the day-ahead scale, a bilateral game interaction framework for the operator of integrated energy system and a calibration model considering differences in energy distinguishing feature in the intraday scale are presented. At the intraday scale, the cold and thermal energy related equipment and controllable resources with low time resolution were modified combined with the day-ahead plan in slow layer, while the power related's with high time resolution were modified combined with the slow layer plan in fast layer. Aim at the above-mentioned complex model, such as multi-objective, nonconvex, strong constraint, large-scale decision variables and irregular Pareto front shape, an adaptive reference point based large scale multi-objective whale optimization algorithm is proposed. Finally, the bilateral interactivity and sensitivity for scheduling results were quantitatively analyzed, under the influence of power generation and consumption uncertainty. The results show that the strategy can balance the economy and robustness, improve the profit benefit of IES by 61.5\% with the traditional robustness. Balance the benefits of market entities, bilateral game can increase the benefit of IES by 57.6\%. The model based on different energy characteristics is more in line with the actual scheduling situation.},

The pyomo.dae framework is integrated with the Pyomo open source algebraic modeling language, and is available at http://www. pyomo.org. One key feature of pyomo.dae is that it does not restrict users to standard, predefined forms of differential equations, providing a high degree of modeling flexibility and the ability to express constraints that cannot be easily specified in other modeling frameworks. Other key features of pyomo.dae are the ability to specify optimization problems with high-order differential equations and partial differential equations, defined on restricted domain types, and the ability to automatically transform high-level abstract models into finite-dimensional algebraic problems that can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers. Moreover, pyomo.dae users can leverage existing capabilities of Pyomo to embed differential equation models within stochastic and integer programming models and mathematical programs with equilibrium constraint formulations. Collectively, these features enable the exploration of new modeling concepts, discretization schemes, and the benchmarking of state-of-the-art optimization solvers.},

  abstract = {Algebraic modeling languages (AMLs) have drastically simplified the implementation of algebraic optimization problems. However, there are still many classes of optimization problems that are not easily represented in most AMLs. These classes of problems are typically reformulated before implementation, which requires significant effort and time from the modeler and obscures the original problem structure or context. In this work we demonstrate how the Pyomo AML can be used to represent complex optimization problems using high-level modeling constructs. We focus on the operation of dynamic systems under uncertainty and demonstrate the combination of Pyomo extensions for dynamic optimization and stochastic programming. We use a dynamic semibatch reactor model and a large-scale bubbling fluidized bed adsorber model as test cases.},

  abstract = {Building stock modelling is a key element for the analysis of energy policy scenarios at an aggregate level, such as the integration of buildings in smart grids. To analyse the impact of new technologies and evaluate the dynamic behaviour at an aggregate level, bottom-up dynamic models are a prerequisite. Nevertheless, data on the building stock characteristics is scarce and assumptions need to be made. A comparison of two residential building stock typologies for Belgium is performed in this work with the aim of identifying their differences and investigating how variations in the representation of a building stock can influence the outcome of the model. For this purpose detailed models of the two typologies are implemented and simulated in Modelica using the IDEAS library. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the heat demand and dynamic behaviour of the stock implementations showed that the inherent differences in the descriptions lead to strong differences in the results, especially when conclusions must be made for specific building cases. This study highlights the need for more reliable and comprehensive data for the building stock, which is a prerequisite for qualitative bottom-up modelling.},

  abstract = {The use of structural thermal storage is often suggested as a key technology to improve the penetration of renewable energy sources and mitigate potential production and distribution capacity issues. Therefore, a quantitative assessment of the energy flexibility provided by structural thermal energy storage is a prerequisite to instigate a large scale deployment of thermal mass as active storage technologies in an active demand response (ADR) context. In the first part of the work, a generic, simulation-based and dynamic quantification method is presented for the characterization of the ADR potential, or energy flexibility, of structural thermal energy storage. The quantification method is based on three ADR characteristics \textendash{} i.e. available storage capacity, storage efficiency and power-shifting capability \textendash{} which can be used to quantify the ADR potential in both design and operation. In the second part of the work, the methodology is applied to quantify the ADR characteristics for the structural thermal energy storage capacity for the different typologies of the Belgian residential building stock. Thereby an in-depth analysis demonstrates the relation between the building properties and its energy flexibility as well as the dependence of the energy flexibility on the dynamic boundary conditions.},
